Numi User Testing: Overview
===========================

Intro
-----
  - changed prototype to provide a better overview of how the different parts of the dialogue flow from one to another.

  - we want you to test out the changes we've made

  - testing prototype ideas, not you

  - testing ideas, not look and feel

  - prototype still not a real working thing, just meant to test the ideas we want to use in the working thing

  - going to go through a set of steps, asking you to click on things, and ask questions at each step

Script
------
- give user link to fin lit dialogue

- explain and make sure user understands what sequences (and blocks) are

- guide the user through navigating paths in dialogue view, make sure they understand what is happening

- tell user to click `[ Overview ]`

- give user a minute to explore the vis, ask them to say out loud what they are thinking

- ask what they expect the following mean:
  - circles
  - lines
  - rectangles
  - circle size
  - text next to circles
  - purple circles and lines

- ask user to click on circle "Glossary Split"

- ask what they expect the following mean:
  - blue circles and lines

  - -s

- ask user to click on circle "Glossary Split" again
