Numi User Testing: Overview
===========================

Intro
-----
  - changed prototype to provide a better overview of how the different parts of the dialogue flow from one to another.
  - we want you to test out the changes we've made
  - testing prototype ideas, not you
  - testing ideas, not look and feel
  - prototype still not a real working thing, just meant to test the ideas we want to use in the working thing
  - going to go through a set of steps, asking you to click on things, and ask questions at each step

Script
------
- explain and make sure user understands what sequences (and blocks) are

- tell user that more visual hints are likely to be given in actual thing, but we want to test how intuitive the vis, so we aren't showing them here

- give user link to fin lit dialogue
- guide the user through navigating paths in dialogue view, make sure they understand what is happening
- tell user to click `[ Overview ]`
- ask user to explain what they are seeing
- ask what they expect the following mean:
  - circles
  - lines
  - rectangles
  - circle size
  - text next to circles
  - purple circles and lines
- ask user to click on circle "Glossary Split"
- ask what they expect the following mean:
  - blue circles and lines
  - +s
  - -s
- ask user to click on circle "Glossary Split" again
- ask what they think just happened
- ask user to click on circle "Glossary Split" again
- ask what they think happened
- refer to `[ Show selected in dialogue | Back to dialogue ]`
- ask what they think each button does
- ask user to click `[ Show selected in dialogue ]`
- ask what they think happened

Ideas to evaluate (cross-check against after testing)
-----------------------------------------------------
- overview button
- vis
  - sequences (circles)
  - routes between sequences (lines)
  - ending sequences (rectangles)
  - sequence names (next to sequence circle/rectangle)
  - number of routes from sequence (circle size)
  - path shown in dialogue (purple circles and lines)
  - selected path (blue circles and lines)
  - collapsed and expanded (fill greyness)
  - collapsing and expanding (clicking on selected node)
  - overall
- showing selected path in dialogue
- going back to dialogue without selecting a path
