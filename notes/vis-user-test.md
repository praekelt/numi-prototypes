Numi User Testing: Overview
===========================

Intro
-----
  - changed prototype to provide a better overview of how the different parts of the dialogue flow from one to another.

  - we want you to test out the changes we've made

  - testing prototype ideas, not you

  - testing ideas, not look and feel

  - prototype still not a real working thing, just meant to test the ideas we want to use in the working thing

  - going to go through a set of steps, asking you to click on things, and ask questions at each step


Script
------
- give user link to fin lit dialogue

- explain and make sure user understands what sequences (and blocks) are

- guide the user to select the following in the edit view, explain what it means:
Welcome screen -> Main Menu -> Tips

- tell user to click `[ Overview ]`

- give user a minute to explore the vis, ask them to say out loud what they are thinking

- ask what they expect the following mean:
  - circles
  - lines
  - circle size
  - text next to circles
  - purple circles and lines
  - blue circles and lines
  - +s
  - -s

- if the user understood the vis differently, explain what the vis is showing

- ask:
Find which sequences the end user could reach from the "Glossary Split" sequence

- ask:
Trace one possible path the end user could take involving "Glossary Split", from start to end of session.

- ask:
Hide the sequences connected to the "Glossary split" sequence

- ask:
Show the path to the "Feedback screen" sequence in the previous page we were viewing before clicking `[ Overview ]`


Ideas to evaluate (cross-check against after testing)
-----------------------------------------------------
- overview button
- vis
  - sequences (circles)
  - routes between sequences (lines)
  - ending sequences (rectangles)
  - sequence names (next to sequence circle/rectangle)
  - number of routes from sequence (circle size)
  - path shown in dialogue (purple circles and lines)
  - selected path (blue circles and lines)
  - collapsed and expanded (fill greyness)
  - collapsing and expanding (clicking on selected node)
  - overall
- showing selected path in dialogue
- going back to dialogue without selecting a path
